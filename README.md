# noSQL Social Network API

## Description
In this challenge, the objective was to build an API for a social network web application using Express.js and to integrate a MongoDB database with Mongoose as the ODM. The API enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage their friend lists. I implemented the required User, Thought, and Reaction models, along with virtuals for friend and reaction counts. The API includes routes for CRUD operations on users and thoughts, as well as routes for adding and removing friends and reactions. Error handling and input validation were incorporated to ensure the API's robustness and security.
